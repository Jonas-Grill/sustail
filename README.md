A webapp to make logistics information of online grocery shopping more transparent. Sustail wants to create a platform, where small producers and later on bigger companies can transparently share their information on the sustainability of their transportation methods. This way we provide a platform not only for sustainable producers but also for customers that want more transparency and sustainability in their lifes. Customers get motivated to buy more sustainable products through gamification (ranking lists/levels) and comparing their sustainability scores on social media via badges.
